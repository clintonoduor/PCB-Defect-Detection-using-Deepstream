# PCB-Defect-Detection-using-Deepstream
Manual visual inspection is one of the most complex and expensive tasks in PCB manufacturing companies. Over the years, Printed Circuit Boards have become much smaller and more densely packed with components making manual visual inspection less scalable. With increased demands from the electronics industry, many defects go unnoticed that may lead to poor company reputation ,and reduced number of contracts.

This project aims to use computer vision to automatically detect 6 PCB Defects using YoloV5 and Deepstream.
